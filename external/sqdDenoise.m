% This function reads in from a sqd file: 157 neuronal channels, 3 reference 
% channels, optionally 3 vibrational reference channels as well as 32
% trigger and all other information channels. It filters the 
% neuronal channels based on the 3 (or 6, if vibrational sensors are used) 
% reference channels, then creates a new sqd file with the filtered neuronal
% data and everything else unmodified. 
% The method is the TSPCA (tsr) and SNS.
%
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The function can be called with 0, 3, 8 or 9 arguments.
% If 0 inputs are specified, the sourcefile is selected through the pop-up
% window. The following inputs are then prompted for:
%
% Enter the channels to be excluded from analysis (MEG number scheme), 
% e.g. [55 79 125]: 
%       At the prompt enter a list of channels to exclude from the noise
%       reduction and instead set equal to zero for all times because they
%       are dead or too noisy. The format of these channels must be 
%       [a b c d]. The channels are numbered as in MEG160 so that the first
%       channel number is 0. If a channel is dead and is not included in 
%       this list, sqdDenoise will return an error.
%
% Do you want saturating channel values set to zero? (yes or no):
%       At the prompt, enter either 'yes' or 'no' (without quotation 
%       marks). 'yes' means that saturating channels are set equal to zero
%       for times at which they are saturating. 'no' means that they are 
%       left at their saturating values.
%
% Enter the MEG trigger channel to which the presence of a saturating
% channel is written (e.g. 161): 
%       At the prompt enter the trigger line (160-188) you wish to use to
%       store the times when clipping channels are present. Do not enter a
%       trigger line which you use for your analysis, as the content of
%       that line will be overwritten.
%
% Do you want to use vibrational reference channels? (yes or no): 
%       At the prompt enter either 'yes' or 'no' (without quotation
%       marks). 'yes' indicates that vibrational reference sensors will be
%       used for denoising purposes. 'no' indicates that they will not. For
%       data taken since October 1 2010 it is recommended that users select
%       'yes'. For data taken prior to that date you MUST use 'no'. 
%
%
% The output file will be the same as the input with the suffix '-Filtered'
% appended.
% Default values will be used for sizeOfBlocks, shifts and nearNeighbors
% (see below).
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% If 3 arguments are used, they must be (in order)
%
% sizeOfBlocks : size of the block to be processed at a time. 
%                The default of this is 25k, corresponding to 50s for a 1kHz
%                sample frequency.
% shifts       : the amount by which we will allow the TSPCA time shift 
%                regression to move. The default is -50:50.
% nearNeighbors: the values used for the nearest neighbors for the SNS 
%                filtering. The default is 10. If this is set equal to 0,
%                SNS will not be used in the denoising.
%
% The same prompts will occur as if no arguments were specified.
% Again, the output file is the same as the input with the suffix
%'-Filtered' appended.
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% If 8 arguments are specified, they must be (in order):
% sizeOfBlocks                 : see above

%                                input file.
% excludedChannels             : In the format [a b c d] this is a list of
%                                channels to exclude from noise reduction
%                                and set to zero. The numbering of channels

%                                in this list, sqdDenoise will return an error.
% doWeZeroSaturatedChannels    : This argument must be either 'yes' or

%                                'yes' means that saturating channels

%                                (including quotation marks). 'yes' means
